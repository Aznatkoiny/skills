# Interview Question Bank

A complete set of interview questions organized by career profile section. Ask ONE question at a time and wait for the user's answer before proceeding to the next question. Use follow-up probes freely — especially in the Achievements section.

2. "What are the 2-3 things you most want a hiring manager to know about you before they read the rest of your resume?"

## Experience Per Role

### Context Questions (ask for each role)

1. "What is the full legal name of the company, and what does it do? A one-sentence description is fine."
2. "What was your official job title? Did your title change during your time there?"
3. "When did you start this role? What month and year?"
4. "Are you still in this role? If not, when did you leave?"
5. "What team or department were you part of? For example, 'Platform Engineering team within the Infrastructure org.'"
6. "How large was your immediate team? And roughly how large was the broader org (company headcount)?"

### Responsibilities Questions

1. "What were your 3 to 5 core day-to-day responsibilities in this role? Don't worry about achievements yet — just what you were expected to do."
2. "Did you have any people management, mentorship, or on-call responsibilities? If so, what did that look like?"
3. "Were you involved in any cross-functional work — collaborating with product, design, data, or business teams? What did that look like?"

### Achievements Questions

**Opening prompt:**
"Now let's talk about accomplishments — this is the most important part. What's something you did in this role that you're proud of, or that had a real impact on the team or company?"

**Quantification probes — use when the user gives a vague answer:**

1. "You mentioned you improved performance — can you quantify that? What was the before and after measurement?"
2. "How many users, customers, or transactions were affected by that change?"
3. "Was there a revenue impact? Even a rough estimate is useful — thousands, millions?"
4. "How much time did that save — per engineer, per week, per deployment?"
5. "What was the scale of the system? Requests per second, data volume, number of services?"
6. "You said you 'led' this effort — how many people were on the team? What was your specific role versus the team's role?"
7. "How long did the project take from kick-off to completion? Was it on time, ahead of schedule, or delayed?"
8. "Was there a cost savings component — cloud spend, tooling costs, headcount efficiency?"
9. "What was the error rate or reliability metric before and after your work?"
10. "Did this result in a promotion, award, or formal recognition?"
11. "If you hadn't done this, what would have broken, slowed down, or cost the company more?"
12. "You mentioned you 'helped' with X — what was your specific contribution versus the team's?"

**Follow-up after a strong answer:**
"That's great — let's capture one or two more. What else are you proud of from this role?"

**If the user is stuck:**
"Sometimes it's easier to think about it this way: Was there a time a manager praised your work? A project that shipped successfully? A fire you put out? A process that didn't exist before you built it?"

### Skills Questions (per role)

1. "What programming languages did you use day-to-day in this role?"
2. "What frameworks, platforms, or cloud providers did you rely on?"
3. "What tools were central to your workflow — CI/CD systems, databases, monitoring, project management?"
4. "Did you use any specific methodologies — Agile, Scrum, Kanban, SRE practices, design thinking?"

## Education

1. "What is the highest degree you've earned? What field of study?"
2. "What institution did you attend, and in what year did you graduate (or expect to graduate)?"
3. "Did you have a GPA above 3.5? If so, do you want to include it? (Generally recommended only for recent graduates.)"
4. "Are there any relevant coursework, honors, awards, or extracurricular activities from your education worth highlighting?"

---

## Projects

1. "Are there any personal, open-source, or side projects that demonstrate your skills and are worth including on a resume?"
2. "For each project: What does it do? What technologies did you use? Did it get any traction — users, stars, downloads, press?"
3. "Is the project publicly available? If so, what's the URL or repository link?"

---
