# Career Coach — Claude Code Plugin

AI-powered career coaching, job search, and resume building plugin for Claude Code. Features a Career Director orchestrator, multi-platform job discovery via MCP, interview preparation, and LaTeX resume compilation.

## Prerequisites

- **Claude Code** CLI
- **Node.js** 18+ (for MCP server)
- **Optional:** LaTeX distribution (`texlive`, `mactex`) for PDF resume compilation
- **Optional:** Pandoc for Markdown-to-PDF conversion
- **Optional:** [Chrome MCP](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-chrome-mcp) for browser-based job application automation

## Installation

```bash
# Add the marketplace
/plugin marketplace add Aznatkoiny/zAI-Skills

# Install the plugin
/plugin install career-coach@zAI-Skills
```

Then restart Claude Code.

### Build the MCP Server

```bash
cd ~/.claude/plugins/cache/zAI-Skills/career-coach/*/mcp-servers/job-intelligence
npm install && npm run build
```

## Quick Start

1. **Build your career profile** — Run the resume updater skill by asking Claude to update your resume. It will interview you to capture your experience, achievements, and career goals into `career-profile.json`.

2. **Select an output style** — Tell Claude your industry (software engineering, AI/ML, sales, consulting) to activate the matching resume format.

3. **Search for jobs** — Ask the Career Director to find jobs matching your profile. It delegates to the Job Search agent which queries Indeed, LinkedIn, TrueUp, Glassdoor, and Levels.fyi.

4. **Generate tailored resumes** — Use `/resume-generator` with a job description to produce a targeted resume.

5. **Prepare for interviews** — Ask for interview prep to activate the Interview Prep agent with mock interviews, behavioral question practice, and company-specific coaching.
