# Software Engineering Output Style

Include sections for:
- Resume Formatting: Section order (Technical Skills → Experience → Projects → Education), achievement metrics (scale: RPS/DAU/data volume, performance: latency/throughput, reliability: uptime/error rates, efficiency: deployment frequency/test coverage), skills format (Languages, Frameworks, Infrastructure, Databases, Tools), project emphasis (open source, system design, architecture)
- Career Advice Framing: Engineering levels (L3-L8 / Junior-Principal-Fellow), technical depth vs breadth, growth signals (scope, complexity, cross-team influence)
- Interview Prep Focus: System design 60%, coding/DSA 25%, behavioral 15%, whiteboard format
- Keyword Optimization (ATS): distributed systems, microservices, CI/CD, cloud infrastructure, API design, database optimization, scalability, observability, infrastructure as code
