# AI/ML Output Style

Include sections for:
- Resume Formatting: Section order (Experience → Publications/Research → Projects → Skills → Education), metrics (accuracy/F1/BLEU, training efficiency, data scale, business impact), skills (Models/Architectures, Frameworks: PyTorch/JAX/TF, Data Tools, Cloud ML, Research Tools)
- Career Advice Framing: Research vs applied paths, publications, conference talks, open source models, titles (Research Scientist, Applied Scientist, ML Engineer)
- Interview Prep Focus: ML system design + technical deep-dive 40%, coding Python/ML 30%, research discussion 20%, behavioral 10%
- Keyword Optimization: machine learning, deep learning, NLP, computer vision, transformers, fine-tuning, RLHF, LLMs, MLOps, distributed training
